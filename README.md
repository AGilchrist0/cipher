# cipher

Cipher is software to assist with solving the [University of Southampton Cipher Challenge](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/) puzzles. It includes:

* `benedict thing.py` = used to split up and recombine vigenere ciphers
* `box.py` = full box cipher solver
* `cipher.py`  = simple letter substitution; useful for trying keys
* `cipher2.py` = full-featured multipurpose substitution solver program, confirmed to be bug-ridden
* `keyword.py` = cracks keyword substitution ciphers
* `letterfinder.py` = outputs all the locations of a chosen letter in a string
* `letterfreq.py` = just a simple frequency analysis program
* `pdssyndicate.py` = searching for 'dssynd' in substitution ciphers
* `reverse.py` = reverses whatever string you throw in its general direction
* `totalconnie thing.py` = finds that number that i can't remember the name of for a range of vigenère keyword lengths
* `vigenere.py` = solves vigenère ciphers given the keyword
* `vigenerefreq.py` = makes a best guess at a vigenère cipher using letter frequency analysis
